## Data encryption

This app encrypts sensitive user attributes (bio, phone, location, website) at rest using Laravel's built-in encrypted casts. Existing data is migrated via `2025_08_16_150000_encrypt_user_pii_fields.php`.

Requirements:
- Ensure `APP_KEY` is set (generated by `php artisan key:generate`).
- Keep `.env` and `APP_KEY` secret. Rotating keys requires decrypt/re-encrypt or re-seeding.

Notes:
- Encrypted casts handle new writes/reads transparently.
- The migration attempts to encrypt any existing plaintext values and skips rows that appear already encrypted.

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Supabase (PostgreSQL) setup

1) Configure environment variables (.env):

```
DB_CONNECTION=pgsql
DB_HOST=your-supabase-host.supabase.co
DB_PORT=5432
DB_DATABASE=postgres
DB_USERNAME=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=your-supabase-password
DB_SSLMODE=require

# Optional: if using the connection pooler (recommended for serverless hosts)
# DB_HOST=your-supabase-host.pooler.supabase.com
# DB_PORT=6543
```

2) Run migrations on Supabase:

- Ensure the database is reachable: `php artisan db:check-pgsql`
- Run: `php artisan migrate --force`

3) Copy existing local data from SQLite to Supabase (optional):

- First, create the schema on Supabase by running migrations (step 2)
- Then run the helper command: `php artisan db:copy-sqlite-to-pgsql --truncate`
- You can limit tables: `php artisan db:copy-sqlite-to-pgsql --tables=users,teams,tasks`

Notes:
- Ensure SSL is required (Supabase uses TLS); set `DB_SSLMODE=require`.
- Review Laravel Sanctum/CORS settings when deploying across domains.
- After switching DBs, clear caches: `php artisan config:clear && php artisan cache:clear`
